# /r/redcss
### Reddit CSS
#### author: Luke E Summerscales @Sadface_RL


## USAGE:
all files in the /css folder
* NON-SASS - Copy/paste the CSS file into your subreddit stylesheet edit it.
* SASS: Download the SCSS to edit and create your CSS file for copy/paste to your subreddit

## Notes:
#### for none CSS users
1. color formats are as follows
   * by name
   * hexadecimal #FFF or #FFFFFF
   * rbga(0,0,0,0)
2. border styling is as follows
   * size line-style color
   * 1px solid red

## SASS LANGUAGE
I recommend using sass if you can http://sass-lang.com/
if you take a peak at the styles.scss file and compare it to
the ordinary styles.css you can see how much easier it is to edit
with scss, unfortunately you cannot just copy the scss file like
you can with the css file.
